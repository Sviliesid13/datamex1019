    "# Challenge 1: Natural Language Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, we will present an overview of Natural Language Processing, or NLP. You will watch two videos to have a general understanding about NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggested time on this challenge: 30 min**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand what is NLP.\n",
    "* Learn about the general evolution of NLP technology.\n",
    "* Learn about the common areas of research in NLP.\n",
    "* Learn about the common applications of NLP.\n",
    "* Understand the general steps to conduct NLP analysis.\n",
    "* Install NLTK.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Install NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start learning, let's first install [Python NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) because it takes a while to download the package. Follow the steps below.\n",

    "### Key Knowledge Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* Computer language vs natural (human) language: how they differ?\n",
    "* Why NLP needs to deconstruct the natural language in order to analyze?\n",
    "* What is the biggest problem for computer to understand natural language?\n",
    "* What is a *parse tree*?\n",
    "* How are the first-generation NLP algorithms (based on semantic rules) different from modern NLP algorithms (based on knowledge graphs and machine learning)?\n",
    "* How did early-generation chatbots (e.g. Eliza) recognize natual languge? What are the limitations?\n",
    "* How do modern chatbots (e.g. [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/how-to-build-a-chatbot/), [Facebook Messenger Chatbot](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/built-in-nlp/)) recognize natural language?\n",
    "* What is speech recognition? What is its relation to NLP?\n",
    "* How does speech recognition work (how do computers translate sounds into texts)?\n",
    "* What is speech synthesis?\n",
    "* What are essential for NLP algorithms to produce more accurate results?\n",
